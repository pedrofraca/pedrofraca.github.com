Welcome to my rebooted blog where I'll try to talk about software engineering and some of the stuff that happens around it. Can't promise that some distorsion of the reality might happen due my romantic view of the software development. Enjoy! 

Appart from writting code I love to collect some old hardwarde and make it work, specially apple hardware. My house is full of old iPods and Apple computers. Not sure if I won't be able to talk about it and how nice they look. :) 

The current set up I'm using to write the code explained in this blog and the blog itself is a Mac Pro 5,1 with dual processor connected to a 23 inches Apple Cinema Display. I use [Dvorak] [dvorak] keyboard distribution which makes me to write faster and annoys people when they try to write using your computer.
