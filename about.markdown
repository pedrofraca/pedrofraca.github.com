Welcome to my rebooted blog where I'll try to talk about software engineering and some other stuff that happens around it. Can't promise that some distorsion of the reality might happen due my romantic view of the software development. 

Appart from writing code I love to collect some old hardwarde and make it work, specially apple hardware from the old days. My house is full of old iPods and Apple computers. Not sure if I'll be able to resist to don't talk about it and how nice they look. :) 

The current set up I'm using to write the code explained in this blog and the blog itself is a Mac Pro 5,1 with:

- 2 x 2,93 GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon
- 64 GB 1333 MHz DDR3
- Radeon RX 460/560 4 GB
- 2 x 23 inches Apple Cinema Display
- NVMExpress drive
- Mac OS Big Sur (Installed using the [SurPlus] [SurPlus] setup with OpenCore)

I use [Dvorak] [dvorak] keyboard distribution which makes me to write faster and annoys people when they try to write using my computer.

Enjoy!
