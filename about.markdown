Welcome to my rebooted blog where I'll try to talk about software engineering and some other stuff that happens around it. Can't promise that some distorsion of the reality might happen due my romantic view of the software development. 

Appart from writting code I love to collect some old hardwarde and make it work, specially apple hardware from the old days. My house is full of old iPods and Apple computers. Not sure if I'll be able to resist to don't talk about it and how nice they look. :) 

The current set up I'm using to write the code explained in this blog and the blog itself is a Mac Pro 5,1 with dual processor connected to a 23 inches Apple Cinema Display, Nvme drive and Mac OS Mojave (still thinking on invert on it or buying an m1). I use [Dvorak] [dvorak] keyboard distribution which makes me to write faster and annoys people when they try to write using my computer.

Enjoy!
